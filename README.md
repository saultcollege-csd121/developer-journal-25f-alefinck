Lab 4 - Build Automation and Testing

###
BOARD class encapsulate state and operations hence the use for the game (tictactoe)
PACKAGES organize code, keeping classes together and avoiding conflicts
each CLASS should have a single work i.e Calculator handles aritimetic, while MathUtils handles utility methods
STATIC METHODS - like "MathUtils.factorial()" can be 'static' so dont need to instantiate the class
ITERATIVE LOOPS are simple and effective for factorial or exponent calculations
JUNIT tests to ensure the expected results
ASSERTIONS to verify correctness and handle exceptions in tests (i.e assertEquals() and assertThrows()
JAVADOC to detail the code as in purpose, parameters, values, etc
